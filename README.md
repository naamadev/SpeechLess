# Real-Time Sign Language Translation App

## Overview
This project is a **real-time application** designed to translate **American Sign Language (ASL)** into text. The goal is to enhance accessibility for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, allowing them to communicate effortlessly with others, including those unfamiliar with sign language.

## Features
- **Real-Time Translation**: Users can communicate in ASL, and the app translates their signs into text instantly.
- **Accessibility**: Provides a platform for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to engage in conversations without the need for human interpreters.
- **Learning Tool**: Offers a feature for users to learn how to sign by displaying the corresponding text for each sign made.
- **Comprehensive Communication**: Supports both word-based and finger-spelling communication, making it versatile for various scenarios.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Implemented using supervised learning techniques with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks.
- **Libraries**:
  - **OpenCV**: For real-time image processing and hand tracking.
  - **Mediapipe**: For hand gesture recognition and tracking.
  - **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the LSTM model.

## Conclusion:
This application aims to bridge communication gaps, fostering inclusivity and understanding among individuals regardless of their hearing abilities. By leveraging machine learning, it brings advanced technology to a critical area of social interaction.
